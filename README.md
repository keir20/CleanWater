# Clean Water for Travellers

Water can contain germs (such as bacteria and viruses) and chemicals which can be harmful and make you unwell. Both tap and bottled water may not be safe if it has not been produced under proper conditions, even if it is clear and colourless.

    - Water should only be used for drinking and preparing food if is known to be safe.
    - This also applies to water used for making ice cubes and cleaning teeth.

When you are travelling, you should take safe food and water precautions to avoid becoming unwell.  This might include you having to treat (purify) your drinking water.

    - Illnesses caused by food and water are more common in countries that have lower levels of hygiene.

You should only use water for drinking, making ice cubes or cleaning teeth if it has been:

    - Bottled or canned by a known manufacturer and the seal is intact
    - Boiled and cooled and stored in a clean container
    - Chemically disinfected or passed through a reliable water filter and stored in a clean container

Even where bottled water is readily available, it is a good idea to have a backup system for making water safe in case you run out of bottled water.

Treating water yourself is also generally agreed to be more 'environmentally friendly' than using bottled water since the same plastic bottle can be reused and refilled.

Our group has developed an algorithm to predict potable water.
